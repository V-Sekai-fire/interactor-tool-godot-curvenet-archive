TOMBSTONE [loop 100/2, 2026-05-09]

Tested for the wrong reason. Hypothesis was that the 81k V-cycle
stall was constant null-space contamination; in fact the matrix's
constant kernel is exact (max |row_sum| = 1.16e-10 in
`tests/diag_70k_cg_baseline.cpp`) and `b` is in range to ~1e-13.
Adding zero-mean projection to the V-cycle was harmless on 81k
(still stalls at 3.7) and harmless on 5k (168 iters preserved).

Algorithm is correct and stays as load-bearing infrastructure for
any future kernel-aware variant (e.g. coarse-grid pinning). Don't
expect it to do anything useful on its own.

----

Kernel-mode projection for V-cycle corrections.

Loop-100 diagnosis: at 81k the multilevel V-cycle stalls at
relative residual ~6e-3 even with always-connected HEM aggregates.
The dynamics (residual drops 5 orders in 20 iters then decays at
~0.99/iter for hundreds of iters) is the signature of constant-
mode drift: the prolonged coarse correction `R^T y_c` is piecewise
constant per cluster and its mean is rarely zero, so each outer
iter shifts the fine solution by `mean(y)` in the constant mode.
With Tikhonov-mollified diagonal the constant mode is near-null,
so this drift takes hundreds of iters to bleed off through the
regularization.

The fix is dirt cheap and load-bearing: project the V-cycle
correction onto the orthogonal complement of the constant mode
before applying it.

  zeroMean v   = v - (sum v / |v|) * 1

Properties verified by native_decide:
  * sum (zeroMean v) ≈ 0
  * idempotent: zeroMean (zeroMean v) ≈ zeroMean v
  * a constant vector projects to zero
  * a vector already orthogonal to 1 is unchanged
